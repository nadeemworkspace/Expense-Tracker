An Expense Tracker application built using SwiftUI, following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This application helps users track their daily expenses, manage their budget, and visualize spending patterns. The Combine framework is used for handling asynchronous network requests and data binding.

## Features

- View expenses based on Date
- Categorize expenses
- Visualize spending patterns with charts

## Architecture

The application follows the MVVM architecture, which separates the app's data (Model) from the UI (View) and the business logic (ViewModel). This promotes a clean and maintainable codebase.
